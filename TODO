* qemu domain 0 backend check
  probable clash over 'params' key with FreeBSD (and other backends)

* prevent shutdown of VMs which are serving SRs
* example needs logging and -daemon option
* do we really need to wait for backend hotplug events?
* if we start a domain on demand, need to ping it until its ready
* Resync.vbd should consider an orphaned frontend to be detached
* if we start a domain on demand, what if the host is offline because the PBD is unplugged
* remove hardcoded IP address
* spurious frontends in dom0? for PV maybe?
